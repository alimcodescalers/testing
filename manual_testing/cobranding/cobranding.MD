##Test Case 1: Adding new organization

**Purpose: Test cobranding is working as expected**

**Steps:**

### Show an organization logo on the login/register screen

When you use the authorization code flow to authenticate your users using Itsyou.Online, you can provide a better user experience by showing your logo on the login page.

To set an organization logo go to the settings page of an organization:

![Organization Settings](OrganizationSettingsTab.png)

and add a logo to your organization:

When a user is asked to login, this logo is added to the login/register page:
